# Abstrasim

AbsTraSim (Absurd Trading Simulator) is a game where the player tries to make
money in a fictional and unrealistic world by trading simulated stocks.

## The Economy

The economy in AbsTraSim is very far from the real world economy. For simplification, we consider that:

- There is only one global and worldly stock exchanges. The W$ (world dollar) is the universal currency.

- For the moment, let us assume that there are no regional differences in the world and that all countries
have similar economies.

- The World Bank is now the central bank for the whole world and gets to decide what interest rates it applies.
Changing this rates DO have an effect (which is probably not that absurd).
